# StockAnalytics
An app which analyses a stock and tells you if it's a fundamentally good company based on balance sheet and other technical parameters.

This app uses an in-built local mock server, written in Swift, located inside the project. You may ask, why? Because, I can not afford to pay for a real stock exchange data.
