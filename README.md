# StockAnalytics
An app which analyses a stock and tells you if it's a fundamentally good company based on balance sheet and other technical parameters.

This app uses a mock server, written in Server-Side-Swift (using Vapor), hosted on Heroku. 
You may ask, why? Because, I don't want to pay for a real stock exchange data.

- Heroku dyno: https://stock-analytics-server.herokuapp.com/api/stocks
